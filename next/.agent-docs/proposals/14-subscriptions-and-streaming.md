## Summary

Decide how procedures stream values, how subscriptions resume, how clients consume streams, and what is deliberately dropped.

**Recommendation:**

- Async iterables (and Effect `Stream`) everywhere; no observables.
- Keep `tracked()`, and move `lastEventId` into the resolver options.
- SSE over fetch streaming instead of `EventSource`.
- Clients consume async iterables.
- Nested deferred values are kept if the danSON-based serializer is adopted (11).

## Today (v11)

- **Subscriptions:**
  - `async function*` resolvers. Observable resolvers are deprecated.
  - `tracked(id, data)` with `lastEventId` merged into the **input**, so the input schema must include it.
  - Transported over SSE (`httpSubscriptionLink` using `EventSource` with an optional polyfill for headers) or `wsLink`.
- **Streaming queries/mutations:** `httpBatchStreamLink` streams async iterables _and nested promises_ inside outputs (JSONL with chunk references).
- **Client:** `.subscribe(input, { onData, onError, onStarted, onComplete, onConnectionStateChange, onStopped })` returns an `Unsubscribable`.
- **SSE config:** `ping`, `maxDurationMs`, reconnect-after-inactivity, set in `initTRPC.create({ sse })`.

## Goals

- One streaming model on the server, `AsyncIterable<T>` or `Stream<T, E, R>`, used for subscriptions and streamed outputs.
- Typed events, typed stream errors (07) and validated items.
- Resumable subscriptions without polluting inputs.
- Works over SSE, JSONL, WebSocket and MessagePort, and is designed for hibernation.

## Decision areas

### (a) Server

```ts
const onPost = t.procedure
  .input(z.object({ channel: z.string() }))
  .output(Post) // for subscriptions, validates each event (see (c))
  .subscription(async function* ({ input, signal, lastEventId }) {
    for await (const post of posts.listen(input.channel, {
      since: lastEventId,
      signal,
    })) {
      yield tracked(post.id, post);
    }
  });

// Effect
const ticks = t.procedure.subscription(() =>
  Stream.tick('1 second').pipe(Stream.map(() => Date.now())),
);
```

- `lastEventId` is a **resolver option**, not part of the input.
- `signal` aborts on client disconnect. Effect streams are interrupted.
- Keepalive and limits (`ping`, `maxDurationMs`) move to the handler or a plugin (12, 13).

### (b) Client

```ts
const sub = client.onPost.subscribe({ channel: 'general' }, { signal, lastEventId });
for await (const post of sub) render(post);

// callbacks as a helper
consume(client.onPost.subscribe({ channel }), { onData, onError, onComplete });
```

- The primary API is `AsyncIterable` (with `return()` to stop). A callback helper is provided for UI code.
- Connection state (`connecting` / `pending` / `error`) is exposed through link events or a `state` property on the iterable (**open**).
- Reconnection with `lastEventId` happens automatically for `tracked()` events, using an Effect `Schedule` for backoff.

### (c) Validation of streamed items

- **Subscriptions:** `.output(schema)` validates _each_ event.
- **Streamed queries and mutations:** use an explicit `stream(schema)` helper (`.output(stream(Post))`), or oRPC's `eventIterator(yieldSchema, returnSchema)`.
- **Open:** a single rule for both kinds (always via `stream()`).

### (d) Transport

- SSE is read with `fetch` streaming, **not** `EventSource`. Headers, POST bodies and abort work natively, so no polyfill is needed.
- The stream format is negotiated per request (10). WebSocket and MessagePort use the shared message model.
- Backpressure: iterables are pull-based on the server. SSE writes respect the platform's stream backpressure.

### (e) Nested deferred values

- v11 can stream `{ fast: 1, slow: Promise<…>, items: AsyncIterable<…> }` (JSONL with chunk references, `stream/jsonl.ts`).
- Options:
  - **D-A** Keep: the serializer supports promises and iterables at any path.
  - **D-B** Root-level iterables only in v1; nested deferral later.
  - **D-C** Drop.
- oRPC supports root-level event iterators only.
- If 11 adopts danSON, **D-A comes almost for free**. danSON streams `Promise`, `AsyncIterable` and `ReadableStream` values at any depth, which is what v11's JSONL codec does today with a separate implementation. The remaining cost is in types (nested `Promise<…>` in outputs) and in integrations (what TanStack Query does with a nested promise).

### (f) Publishing events

- Effect users have `PubSub` and `Stream.fromPubSub`. Document these.
- For Promise users, a small `createPublisher<Events>()` (memory, with optional resume buffer) can be provided. Redis and Durable Object publishers come later, as in oRPC's publisher helpers.

### (g) Cloudflare hibernation

The WebSocket message model (10) lets a hibernated Durable Object rebuild subscription routing from socket attachments. The full integration (oRPC's "durable iterator") is **later**, but nothing in v1 may keep subscription state _only_ in process memory without an abstraction for it.

## Recommendation

- (a) and (b) as above, with callbacks as a helper.
- `.output()` validates subscription events; `stream()` is used for streamed queries.
- Fetch-based SSE.
- **D-A** if 11 adopts danSON; otherwise **D-B** (root-level only in v1).
- A memory publisher, with Effect `PubSub` documented.
- Hibernation-ready design, with the implementation later.

## Questions for Alex

- **Q14.1** Client subscriptions: `AsyncIterable` first (recommended), or keep callbacks as the primary API?
- **Q14.2** Move `lastEventId` from the input to resolver options?
- **Q14.3** Stream item validation: `.output()` per event for subscriptions + `stream()` for queries, or always `stream()`?
- **Q14.4** Nested deferred values: keep (D-A), later (D-B) or drop (D-C)?
- **Q14.5** Drop `EventSource` in favour of fetch-streamed SSE?
- **Q14.6** Ship a `createPublisher()` helper in v1?
- **Q14.7** Cloudflare hibernation in v1 or later?
