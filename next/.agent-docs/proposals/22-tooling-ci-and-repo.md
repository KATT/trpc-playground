# 22 — Tooling, CI, repo layout and examples

| Status     | Area       | Depends on | oRPC parity rows |
| ---------- | ---------- | ---------- | ---------------- |
| `proposed` | repo, docs | 01, 21     | —                |

## Summary

`ideas.md` sets these constraints:

- The only dev dependencies are "Vite family stuff (vitest, oxlint, oxfmt, their monorepo tooling)", TypeScript (latest), pnpm and Effect.
- "Recreate all CI things to be a lot simpler."
- "Some precommit hook that auto-formats + runs tests on what is changed is enough."
- Markdown docs only; examples that work with linked local packages.
- Tests are mainly integration tests.

**Recommendation:**

- **Vite+** (`vite-plus`, `vp`) as the single toolchain. It bundles Vitest, Oxlint, Oxfmt, Rolldown/tsdown and Vite Task, and it provides git hooks and staged-file runs.
- TypeScript 7.
- One small CI workflow.
- A fresh repo layout on the `v12` branch.

## Today (v11)

- **Tooling:** pnpm 12.4.1, Node ^24, lerna, turbo, eslint + typescript-eslint, prettier, manypkg, tsdown 0.23, vitest 5, vite 8, TypeScript ^7.0.2. There is a `ts-api` catalog pinned to TypeScript ^6 for tools that need the JS compiler API (`@trpc/openapi`, `@trpc/upgrade`).
- **`.github/workflows`:** `main`, `lint`, `release`, `codeql-analysis`, `labeler`, `lock-issues`, `dependabot-approve`, `semantic-pr`, `subtree` (syncs examples to downstream repos), `check-skills`, `validate-skills` and `notify-intent`.
- About 35 examples, a Docusaurus site (`www/`), and `vendor-src` (with a `postinstall: vendor-src check`) for `.repos/`. The trees and the devDependency now live in `next/` (`next/.repos/`). The config stays at the repo root (`vendor-src.json`, `"dir": "next/.repos"`), because vendor-src resolves the project as the nearest directory with both `.git` and `package.json`.
- Recent drafts: [#7348](https://github.com/trpc/trpc/pull/7348) (TS7), [#7352](https://github.com/trpc/trpc/pull/7352) (replace Lerna), [#7205](https://github.com/trpc/trpc/pull/7205) and [#7206](https://github.com/trpc/trpc/pull/7206) (oxfmt/oxlint), [#7305](https://github.com/trpc/trpc/pull/7305) (knip).

The two shapes in Q22.1, as root `package.json` scripts:

```jsonc
// Vite+ (next/package.json today)
"scripts": { "check": "vp check", "fix": "vp check --fix", "test": "vp test run" }

// individual tools wired with pnpm scripts
"scripts": { "check": "oxfmt --check && oxlint", "fix": "oxfmt && oxlint --fix", "test": "vitest run" }
```

## Precommit hook

```ts
// vite.config.ts (sketch; verify against Vite+ docs)
export default defineConfig({
  staged: {
    '*': 'vp check --fix', // format + lint (+ types?) staged files
    '*.{ts,tsx}': 'vp test related --run', // vitest: tests related to the changed files
  },
});
```

`vp hooks` installs the git hook dispatcher, so husky, lint-staged and simple-git-hooks are not needed.

## CI (one workflow)

`.github/workflows/next.yml` runs on push to `v12` and on PRs:

1. `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile` with a cache.
2. `vp check` (format, lint, types), with no auto-fix.
3. `vp test --run` (all Vitest projects, integration-heavy).
4. **Portability fixture:** builds `test/portability` with `declaration: true` and fails on TS2742 (01).
5. **Examples:** typecheck and build every example against `workspace:*` packages.
6. **Optional matrix:** latest Effect minor (02 (h)), plus a bundle-size budget check (02 (g)).

Abbreviated from the workflow that exists today, [`.github/workflows/next.yml`](../../../.github/workflows/next.yml). The `effect-latest` job is a sketch and is not in the file.

```yaml
on:
  push: { branches: [v12], paths: ['next/**', '.github/workflows/next.yml'] }
  pull_request: { paths: ['next/**', '.github/workflows/next.yml'] }
defaults:
  run: { working-directory: next }
jobs:
  check:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v7
      - uses: pnpm/action-setup@v6
        with: { package_json_file: next/package.json }
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v7
        with:
          {
            node-version: 24,
            cache: pnpm,
            cache-dependency-path: next/pnpm-lock.yaml,
          }
      - run: pnpm install --frozen-lockfile # 1
        env: { VP_GIT_HOOKS: '0' }
      - run: pnpm typecheck # 2 types, in every package including test/portability (4) and examples/* (5)
      - run: pnpm check # 2: vp check, no --fix
      - run: pnpm test # 3: vp test run
  effect-latest: # 6 (optional)
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      # same setup steps as `check`, then:
      - run: pnpm up -r effect@latest && pnpm typecheck && pnpm test
```

Every other workflow is deleted. CodeQL, labeler, release and similar can come back individually when needed.

## Repo layout on `v12`

New implementation lives under **`next/`** (own pnpm workspace), so the leftover v11 tree at the repo root is not mixed in:

```text
next/                         ← code root (cd here to work)
  AGENTS.md                   agent instructions (root AGENTS.md only points here)
  .agent-docs/                proposals, decisions, reference and notes (this folder)
  .repos/                     vendored sources (vendor-src, read-only; config in ../vendor-src.json)
  packages/trpcdev/           core package (01)
  packages/tanstack-query/    @trpcdev/tanstack-query (19, later)
  examples/minimal/           …
  examples/effect/            …
  examples/next-app/          Next.js app (name is the framework, not this folder)
  examples/openapi/
  examples/realtime/
  docs/                       Markdown user docs
  test/portability/           TS2742 fixture (01)
  spikes/                     throwaway experiments (results in .agent-docs/notes/)
packages/, examples/, www/    leftover v11 — do not extend; delete when Alex says (Q22.5)
```

- Examples depend on `trpcdev: workspace:*` inside the `next/` workspace. No `subtree` syncing.

  ```jsonc
  // next/examples/minimal/package.json
  {
    "name": "@example/minimal",
    "private": true,
    "scripts": { "typecheck": "tsc --noEmit -p tsconfig.json" },
    "dependencies": { "trpcdev": "workspace:*" },
  }
  ```

- Agent docs moved from the repo-root `vnext/` to `next/.agent-docs/` (2026-10-09), so `next/` is self-contained when opened as a workspace root.

## Recommendation

Adopt the toolchain, hook, CI and layout above. Verify these details against Vite+'s docs during the setup commit:

- `vp check` type-checking with tsgo;
- the `staged` command semantics;
- `vp test related`.

## Questions for Alex

- **Q22.1** Vite+ (`vp`) as the single toolchain, or the individual tools (vitest, oxlint, oxfmt, tsdown) wired with pnpm scripts?
- **Q22.2** Precommit hook: format + lint + related tests on staged files via `vp staged`. Should it also typecheck?
- **Q22.3** Keep `vendor-src` as an allowed dev dependency?
- **Q22.4** The proposed example set: add or remove any?
- **Q22.5** Delete v11 code from `v12` right after 01/22 are decided, or keep it until vNext reaches parity on the basics?

## Decision

- **Q22.1:** [ ] Vite+ · [ ] individual tools
- **Q22.2:** typecheck in hook: [ ] yes · [ ] no
- **Q22.3:** [x] yes · [ ] no (root deps are `dependencies`) → [0007](../decisions/0007-vendor-src-and-root-dependencies.md)
- **Q22.4:** `__________`
- **Q22.5:** [ ] delete early · [ ] keep until parity
- **Notes:**
