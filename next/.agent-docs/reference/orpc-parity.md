# oRPC parity matrix

**Goal from `ideas.md`:** feature parity with [orpc.dev/docs/comparison](https://orpc.dev/docs/comparison). Any API decision that could stop us from getting there must be flagged and confirmed by Alex before it is accepted.

Source: `.repos/orpc/apps/content/docs/comparison.md` (oRPC `v1.15.5`). The oRPC and tRPC columns are copied from that table. The tRPC column is oRPC's assessment of v11 and may lag behind recent v11 work.

Legend: ✅ first-class · 🟡 partial / third-party · 🛑 not supported. **Risk** marks the decisions that could block us.

¹ v11 recently gained per-procedure `.errors()` formatters ([#7591](https://github.com/trpc/trpc/pull/7591)) and `safe()` on the client. oRPC's table predates this.
² Experimental (`experimental_caller`, `experimental_nextAppDirCaller`).

## The decisions that matter most for parity

These are the bold rows above. Get them right and every other row is incremental work:

1. **Split contract from implementation in the procedure data model** (03, 09). Contract-first, OpenAPI links, NestJS and client-side validation all depend on it.
2. **Put serialization on endpoints, not on the router** (11). One router must be servable by an RPC endpoint (rich serializer) _and_ an OpenAPI endpoint (plain JSON) at the same time.
3. **Keep the protocol and handler transport-agnostic** (10, 12). HTTP, WebSocket and MessagePort share one message model.
4. **Allow per-procedure HTTP routing metadata** (04, 18): `.route({ method, path, … })`.

## oRPC features outside the table

oRPC ships these beyond the comparison rows. They are not parity requirements, but each one should be considered:

## Maintenance

- When a proposal's decision changes a row's plan, update the row in the same commit.
- If a decision would turn a row's plan into 🛑, the agent must stop and ask Alex (see `../approach.md`).
- Re-check against the upstream comparison page when bumping the vendored oRPC version.
