# tRPC vNext: design proposals

This folder holds the **design** work for the next version of tRPC, following `../ideas.md`. **Implementation lives in [`../next/`](../next/)** — do not put new packages in the root `packages/` tree.

It contains:

- **[`approach.md`](./approach.md):** how we work. It covers the process, how agents use this folder, principles, the technical approach, phases and risks. Start here.
- **[`proposals/`](./proposals):** one file per API area. Each has today's v11 behaviour, options with code sketches, a recommendation, numbered questions and a blank **Decision** block.
- **[`decisions/`](./decisions):** the decision log (empty until Alex decides).
- **[`reference/`](./reference):** shared background.
  - [`orpc-parity.md`](./reference/orpc-parity.md): the oRPC comparison table mapped to proposals, and the decisions that could block parity.
  - [`v11-inventory.md`](./reference/v11-inventory.md): what v11 ships, and whether each item is kept, changed or deleted.
  - [`prior-art.md`](./reference/prior-art.md): abandoned tRPC PRs, danSON, Effect v4 and oRPC.
- **[`notes/`](./notes):** agent working notes and spike results.

## How to decide

Tick boxes in a proposal's **Decision** block, or reply in chat, for example `07: Q7.1 combined, Q7.3 [data, error]`. Partial answers are fine; anything unanswered stays open. The agent records each decision in `decisions/` and ripples it through dependent proposals. Full process in [`approach.md`](./approach.md#1-process-proposals--decisions--code).

## Already decided in `ideas.md`

These are treated as given:

- Effect is the only dependency.
- One package called `trpcdev` with `/server`, `/client`, … subpaths. Integrations with external dependencies are separate packages.
- Transformers move to endpoints.
- `@trpc/react-query` is dead.
- Markdown docs only.
- The `@trpcdev` npm scope, with no releases yet.
- `v12` branch on KATT/trpc-playground, with semantic commits and no PRs.

⚠️ marks proposals where some options would block a row in the [oRPC parity matrix](./reference/orpc-parity.md).

## If you only answer a few questions

These have the most leverage: they shape every other proposal and every code sample.

1. **Q3.3** Generic builder: an internal generic core with a closed public builder and opt-in wrappers (recommended), or a public extension API?
2. **Q2.1** Effect handlers in the same builder (recommended), or a separate Effect flavour?
3. **Q7.1** Error model: returned/inferred errors + optional declared map + mapping middleware (recommended)?
4. **Q11.1 / Q11.3** danSON as the serializer, and which legible GET encoding?
5. **Q10.1 / Q10.2** New protocol? `/post/byId` or `/post.byId`?
6. **Q17.3** How links inform call options: `createTRPCClient({ router: type<AppRouter>(), links })`, curried, or a second generic?
7. **Q9.1** Contract syntax: resolver-less `.query()` terminals?
8. **Q12.1** Own web-standard core with Effect platform Layers (recommended), or build on `effect/http`?
9. **Q16.1 / Q19.2** Client calls `query(input, opts)` and TanStack `queryOptions({ input })`?
10. **Q22.1** Vite+ as the single toolchain?

## Parity-critical decisions

Getting these wrong would block rows of the oRPC comparison (details in [`orpc-parity.md`](./reference/orpc-parity.md#the-decisions-that-matter-most-for-parity)):

- **Contract and implementation must be separable** in the procedure data model (03, 09). This affects contract-first, the OpenAPI link and NestJS.
- **Serialization lives on endpoints, not the router** (11). One router must serve RPC and OpenAPI.
- **The protocol and handler must not assume HTTP** (10, 12). This affects MessagePort and WebSocket hibernation.
- **Per-procedure HTTP route metadata** (04, 18). This affects OpenAPI.
- **A framework-agnostic TanStack integration** (19). This affects Vue, Solid, Svelte and Angular.
