# 21 — Stability tiers, JSDoc and deprecation

| Status     | Area      | Depends on | oRPC parity rows |
| ---------- | --------- | ---------- | ---------------- |
| `proposed` | all, docs | 01         | —                |

## Summary

`ideas.md` asks for two things:

- "JSDoc on every public function."
- "Mark unstable internals more clearly than today."

**Recommendation:**

- Mark stability in JSDoc (`@stability`, `@since`), following Effect's convention, and use experimental _entry points_ instead of name prefixes.
- A `./internal` entry point with no semver guarantees.
- A CI check that every public export has JSDoc with the required tags.

## Today (v11)

- Name prefixes: `experimental_caller`, `unstable_concat`, `unstable_localLink`, `experimental_standaloneMiddleware`, … Stabilising an API means renaming it, which breaks users and leaves deprecated aliases behind.
- `@trpc/server/unstable-core-do-not-import` is imported by every official package. Its name says "do not import", but users still reach for it to name types (TS2742; see 01).
- JSDoc coverage is partial. A website hosts the docs.

## Effect's convention (`effect@4.0.2`)

```ts
/**
 * Creates a handler for a router.
 *
 * @example
 * const handler = createHandler({ router })
 *
 * @since 4.0.0
 * @category constructors
 * @stability unstable
 */
```

`@stability unstable` means breaking changes can land in minors. `experimental` means breaking changes can land in patches. No name prefixes (`MIGRATION.md`).

## Options

- **ST-A — JSDoc tags only** (Effect). Stable names; stability is visible in hovers and in generated docs.
- **ST-B — Name prefixes** (v11).
- **ST-C — Entry-point tiers.** Experimental APIs only live under `…/experimental` (for example `trpcdev/server/experimental`), so the import path shows the tier.
- **ST-A + ST-C:** both. The entry point gives a coarse signal, the JSDoc gives precision.

## Proposed rules

1. Every export from a public entry point has JSDoc with a summary, at least one `@example` for functions, `@since` and `@stability` (`stable` | `unstable` | `experimental`).
2. **No `unstable_` / `experimental_` name prefixes.** Experimental APIs live in `/experimental` entry points. Graduating an API moves its export, while the old path keeps re-exporting it with `@deprecated` for one minor version.
3. `./internal` is the glue for first-party packages. It has no semver guarantees, its JSDoc header says so, and every export is tagged `@internal` (not stripped, because types must stay nameable; see 01).
4. Deprecations carry `@deprecated <replacement>` and are removed in the next major. **vNext starts with zero deprecated aliases.**
5. A CI script (TypeScript compiler API, no extra dependencies) fails if a public export is missing JSDoc or the required tags, or if a stable entry point re-exports something tagged experimental.
6. API reference Markdown can be generated from the JSDoc into `docs/reference/` (**open**).

## Recommendation

**ST-A + ST-C** with the rules above. `@since` starts at the first vNext version (Q21.2).

## Questions for Alex

- **Q21.1** Stability via JSDoc tags + experimental entry points, and no name prefixes?
- **Q21.2** Version label for `@since`: `12.0.0`, or something else (is vNext "v12")?
- **Q21.3** A `./internal` entry point with no semver guarantees for first-party packages?
- **Q21.4** Enforce JSDoc rules with a CI script?
- **Q21.5** Generate API reference Markdown from JSDoc?

## Decision

- **Q21.1:** [ ] yes · [ ] prefixes · [ ] other
- **Q21.2:** `@since` = `________`
- **Q21.3:** [ ] yes · [ ] no
- **Q21.4:** [ ] yes · [ ] no
- **Q21.5:** [ ] yes · [ ] no · [ ] later
